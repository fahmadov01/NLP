# NLP Project - Spring 2025
- Nate Cowan

## Overview
This project implements a clickbait headline detection system using multiple different NLP algorithms. The models are trained on a labeled dataset of news headlines, where each entry is labeled as either **clickbait (1)** or **not clickbait (0)**.

This README provides detailed instructions on how to reproduce the results in a clean environment, including environment setup, data access, preprocessing steps, training procedures, and output expectations.
